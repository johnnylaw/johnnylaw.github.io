This site is the most brand-newest thing on the web, but that doesn't mean that I am; I've been in technology for most of my adult life, having received an MSEE in Digital Signal Processing. I made my foray into web development as the technical co-founder of [BodyworkSites](https://www.bodyworksites.com/) in 2006. Since 2009 I've worked as a Ruby consultant and recently served as a lead instructor for the 12-week Web Development Immersive program at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Santa Monica campus.

My passion is for helping fast-growing startups with the process of on-boarding new engineers, getting those engineers up to speed with industry and company best practices as quickly as possible.
